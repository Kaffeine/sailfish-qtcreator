    This tutorial describes how to use \QC to create a SailfishOS application.

    \section1 Creating the Project

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui File > \gui {New File or Project} > \gui SailfishOS >
            \gui {SailfishOS Qt Quick Application} > \gui Choose.

        \li In the \gui{Name} field, type \bold {HelloWorld}.

        \li In the \gui {Create in} field, enter the path for the project files.
            For example, \c {C:\Qt\examples}, and then click \gui{Next} (on
            Windows and Linux) or \gui Continue (on Mac OS).

        \li Select the SailfishOS \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kit} for running
            and building your project, and then click \gui{Next}. If the path
            provided in the previous step is outside the directory shared with
            MerSDK Virtual Machine, an appropriate warning is shown.

            \note Kits are listed if they have been specified in \gui Tools >
            \gui Options > \gui {Build & Run} > \gui Kits. If a suitable kit is
            missing, see \l{Connecting SailfishOS Devices}.

        \li In the \gui {Application Details} dialog, specify information about the
            application. The information can be displayed in the app store and
            on the device.

            \image creator-sailfish-tutorial-3.png "Application Details dialog"

        \li Select \gui Next.

        \li Review the project settings, and click \gui{Finish} (on Windows and
            Linux) or \gui Done (on Mac OS) to create the project.

    \endlist

    \QC generates a default QML file that you can modify to create the main view
    of the application.

    \section1 Building and Running the Project

    \list 1

        \li In the target selector, select the SailfishOS kit.

        \li Press \key {Ctrl+R} to build the application.

            \QC copies the necessary files to the connected SailfishOS device and runs
            the application on it.

    \endlist
